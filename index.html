          "I never quite understood it, this sex symbol. I always thought
          symbols were those things you clash together! That's the trouble, a
          sex symbol becomes a thing. I just hate to be a thing. But if I'm
          going to be a symbol of something I'd rather have it sex than some
          other things they've got symbols of."
